            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being very inteallgent animals, parrots need ways to pass the time and to stimulate their brains. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can lead to boredom and the stress associated with the inability to perform <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;natural behaviors are common challenges associated with bringing animals into our homes because <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they rely heavily on their natural instincts. Our goal for the birds in captivity should be to replicate <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their natural history and environment as much as possible in captivity to avoid the development of major<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;social, behavioral, and physiological issues. For instance, research indicates that the<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intelligence of Psittacines is comparable to that of a 3-5 year old human child, so they deserve a similar<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;level of stimulation and socialization throughout their day to day routines to ensure<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate development and quality of life.<br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;Without environmental enrichment, a birdâ€™s boredom may progress to stress and changes in behavior.<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Some common causes of stress in captive animals include restrictive enclosures, suboptimal<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;nutrition, the reduced or restricted ability to exercise, inadequate habitat,<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;and a lack of mental stimulation.<br />

        <h3>Some signs that your Parrot may be stressed </h3>

        <li>
            <ul>Screaming, especially for long periods of time (more than five to ten minutes at a time)</ul>
            <ul>Feather destructive behavior</ul>
            <ul>Clinging. The bird wants to constantly be with the caregiver. The caregiver has become the entertainment center for the bird!</ul>

    <h2>Ways to Entertain your Parrot</h2>

    <p>

        Environmental enrichment is a means to provide pet birds in captivity with the ability to express natural behavior,
        such as foraging, exploration, exercise, etc. Some of the most common themes for enrichment that we focus on with pet Psittacines include:
        providing opportunities to exhibit foraging behavior, investigation of novel items, destroying/manipulating items 
        (like tearing up a phone book or newspaper), social interaction, the opportunity to exercise (climb, fly, etc.), and puzzles to manipulate.

        There are many different options when it comes to empowering our pets through enrichment, and a little creativity will serve you well. 
        Some items for enrichment can be bought at a store, but most enrichment can be done through using what you already have at home. 
        Here are a few ideas to get you started, but the sky is the limit when it comes to what you can offer.

    <li>
        <ul>Provide safe items for movement and stimulation (toys, treats, swinging perches)</ul>
        <ul>Use training and rewards to challenge them mentally</ul>
        <ul>Change up their environment (move items in their cage a few times per week, add a new item)</ul>
        <ul>Provide perches of a variety of shapes/textures/materials and diameters to replicate natural perches and ensure foot health</ul>
        <ul>Give items to stimulate natural behaviors like foraging, climbing, and perching (hide treats in grass, add items to shred)</ul>
        <ul>Provide simple items for them to play with (recycled coffee filters, toilet paper tubes, and paper cups)</ul>
        <ul>Hang treats and fruit from the top of the cage to challenge them physically</ul>
        <ul>Use food dispenser toys so the bird has to work for food (ball with holes in it)</ul>
        <ul>Add safe components of their natural environment (sticks for perching, leaves)</ul>
        <ul>Provide out of enclosure time with you.</ul>
        <ul>Make sure they have a proper day/night cycle</ul>
