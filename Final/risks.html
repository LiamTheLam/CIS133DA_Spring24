        <h1> Parrots are Amazing Compantions! But...</h1>
        <p>
            Keeping a pet parrot is a vibrant and rewarding experience, still taking care of a Parrot is easy said than <br />
            done. Yes, even the smaller parrots are a handful. However, prospective parrot owners must consider <br />
            several significant downsides. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            Parrots, inherently social and complex creatures, require extensive daily interaction and mental stimulation<br />
            that mimic their natural behaviors, failing which they often develop behavioral issues such as screaming and<br />
            feather plucking. This, combined with their need for specialized diets and potential for unexpected veterinary<br />
            expenses, makes owning a parrot a demanding and long-term responsibility that is not suited for everyone.<br />

        <h2>Mischiefious and Messy</h2>
        <img class="floatLeft" src="Decor/chewing.jpg" alt="chewing">
        <p>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Parrots are naturally messy and can be quite destructive, characteristics that can pose considerable challenges
            &nbsp;&nbsp;for even the most dedicated pet owners. In their native habitats, these birds are accustomed to foraging and chewing,
            &nbsp;&nbsp;habits that they carry into the home environment. This can lead to damaged furniture, torn books, and shredded curtains
            &nbsp;&nbsp;as they exercise their strong beaks and curious nature. Their feeding habits contribute to the mess, as they often scatter
            &nbsp;&nbsp;food and debris around their cages and nearby areas, necessitating frequent, thorough cleanups. Additionally, parrots
            &nbsp;&nbsp;produce a significant amount of dander and dust from their feathers, which can be problematic for cleanliness and may
            &nbsp;&nbsp;trigger allergies in some people.

        <h2>Long Life Span</h2>

        <p>
            The life span of a parrot depends on the speices, but their remarkably long lifespan means a commitment that can span several
            decades, often outliving their initial purchase expectations. A rough avarage of a parrots put it into propestive would be around
            50 years! even Budiges can live over 15 years with the right care! Depending on you and your parrot's age, it maybe be like for 
            your feather friend to out live. 
            For more informations on a speices' lifespan there is a table below this paragraph explaining just that.
