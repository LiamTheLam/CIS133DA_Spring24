        <h1> Parrots are Amazing Compantions! But...</h1>
        <p>
            Keeping a pet parrot is a vibrant and rewarding experience, still taking care of a Parrot is easy said than <br />
            done. Yes, even the smaller parrots are a handful. However, prospective parrot owners must consider <br />
            several significant downsides. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            Parrots, inherently social and complex creatures, require extensive daily interaction and mental stimulation<br />
            that mimic their natural behaviors, failing which they often develop behavioral issues such as screaming and<br />
            feather plucking. This, combined with their need for specialized diets and potential for unexpected veterinary<br />
            expenses, makes owning a parrot a demanding and long-term responsibility that is not suited for everyone.<br />

        <h2>Mischiefious and Messy</h2>

        <p>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Parrots are naturally messy and can be quite destructive, characteristics that can pose considerable challenges
            &nbsp;&nbsp;for even the most dedicated pet owners. In their native habitats, these birds are accustomed to foraging and chewing,
            &nbsp;&nbsp;habits that they carry into the home environment. This can lead to damaged furniture, torn books, and shredded curtains
            &nbsp;&nbsp;as they exercise their strong beaks and curious nature. Their feeding habits contribute to the mess, as they often scatter
            &nbsp;&nbsp;food and debris around their cages and nearby areas, necessitating frequent, thorough cleanups. Additionally, parrots
            &nbsp;&nbsp;produce a significant amount of dander and dust from their feathers, which can be problematic for cleanliness and may
            &nbsp;&nbsp;trigger allergies in some people.
