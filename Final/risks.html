        <h1> Parrots are Amazing Compantions! But...</h1>
        <p>
            Keeping a pet parrot is a vibrant and rewarding experience, still taking care of a Parrot is easy said than done. Yes, even the 
            smaller parrots are a handful. However, prospective parrot owners must consider several significant downsides. 
        
            Parrots, inherently social and complex creatures, require extensive daily interaction and mental stimulation that mimic their natural
            behaviors, failing which they often develop behavioral issues such as screaming and feather plucking. 
            This, combined with their need for specialized diets and potential for unexpected veterinary expenses, 
            makes owning a parrot a demanding and long-term responsibility that is not suited for everyone.
