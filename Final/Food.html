    <h1>How To Feed An Adult Parrot</h1>
    

    <p>An adult parrot's diet should consist of 70 to 90% pellet food and 10 to 30% percent fresh foods, including fruits, vegetables, seeds, treats, and nuts.</p>

    <p>So, when's mealtime? It depends on who you ask. There are varying discussions on when to feed a pet parrot. Some veterinarians think having food<br />
    available at all times in the cage is optimal. Others recommend two daily measured meals. But, check with your veterinarian for what they<br />
    recommend for your pet parrot.</p>

    <p>When it comes to specific portions, read the pellet food package for guidelines based on your parrot type, weight, and age.</p>
    
        <h2>Which Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Are Safe For Parrots?</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class="floatRight" src="Decor/Hungry.avif" alt="heEAT">
        <p>Offer fresh produce straight from your garden or a farmer's market. Fresh frozen or canned foods packed in water (no oils, salt, or seasonings) are also good options.<br />
        Avoid fresh supermarket produce that's polished with waxes or sprayed with preservatives.</p>

        <p>Pet parrots enjoy a variety of produce, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apples</li>
            <li>Beans (boiled kidney, lima, navy, pinto)</li>
            <li>Bell peppers</li>
            <li>Broccoli</li>
            <li>Cantaloupe</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>Chickpeas (boiled)</li>
            <li>Dandelion leaves</li>
            <li>Dark leafy vegetables (bok choy, carrot tops, kale, spinach)</li>
            <li>Dates</li>
            <li>Lentils (boiled)</li>
            <li>Mango</li>
            <li>Papaya</li>
            <li>Pineapple</li>
            <li>Rice (white or brown, boiled)</li>
            <li>Silverbeet (also known as Swiss chard)</li>
            <li>Squash</li>
            <li>Sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>Yams</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="startOverRover"></div>
    <p>Serve fresh, steamed, or boiled produce, then mashed or broken into small crumbles via a food processor. Skip the butter, oil, and seasonings.</p>

    <p><i>Note: Parrots are prone to obesity, fatty liver disease, heart disease, and nutritional deficiencies. Schedule annual check-ups with an avian<br /> 
    veterinarian to keep your pet healthy.</i></p>

        <h2>Can Parrots Have Treats?</h2> 
        <p>Of course, parrots can have treats! You can spoil your pet parrot with snacks like treat sticks, whole unsalted peanuts in the shell, and some table scraps.<br /> 
        They love an al dente pasta noodle, a bite of dry wholewheat toast, and even a slice of jalapeno pepper (with seeds, in moderation, is fine). </p> 

        <p>Just remember, treats are an occasional special item. So limit treats to a few bites a week. It's OK to share some penne with your parrot on pasta night!</p>

        <p>Avoid giving onions, chocolate, or avocados to your pet parrot. You may consider them "treat worthy," but these are toxic to your parrot.</p>

        <p>Parrots have robust appetites and require varied diets of fresh and pellet foods to stay healthy. The idea that birds only eat seeds is outdated and out<br />
