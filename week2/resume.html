    <p>
        Velociraptor (/vəˌlɒsɪˈræptər, vəˈlɒsɪræptər/;[1] lit. 'swift thief') is a genus of small dromaeosaurid dinosaurs that<br />
        lived in Asia during the Late Cretaceous epoch, about 75 million to 71 million years ago. Two species are<br />
        currently recognized, although others have been assigned in the past. The type species is V. mongoliensis,<br />
        named and described in 1924. Fossils of this species have been discovered in the Djadochta Formation,<br />
        Mongolia. A second species, V. osmolskae, was named in 2008 for skull material from the Bayan Mandahu<br />
        Formation, China.<br>
